thanks for asking so steve it looks like you opted into one of our ads looking for information on solar did you happen to build yourself a design or have one emailed to you"},{"from":"steve yeah i had one emailed to me","value":"you awesome thats exactly why im calling im actually a manager on milk solars design team and i wanted to check in with you to see if theres any way we can help you by the way just a heads up some people have mentioned that the audio is a bit laggy today so if theres any delay or if i cut you off i apologize in advance anyway im curious what had you looking into solar in the first place"},{"from":"steve um i really wanted to save money on electricity and the utility companies are really expensive so i knew that this would be a good idea","value":"you i totally get where youre coming from steve saving money on electricity bills is a big motivator for a lot of people so lets say everything went perfectly and you were using solar to get rid of the utility company thats milking all of us how much money do you think youd actually be saving over the course of years"},{"from":"steve um i gotta spend money on solar right","value":"you absolutely there is an initial investment in solar but its important to consider the longterm savings so why did you choose that specific number what gets you excited about hitting that savings goal"},{"from":"steve i mean if i was saving money i wouldnt be paying the utility company theyre really pricey","value":"you i hear you steve it makes total sense why youd be excited about saving money and reducing your reliance on the utility company can you tell me more about why its important for you to have that financial freedom and not be tied down by high utility costs"},{"from":"steve well because i dont own the utility company im just renting it i just know power is expensive and solar is not i guess","value":"you no worries steve we work with a variety of financing options so even if your credit isnt perfect there may still be options available for you our team can help guide you through the process and find a solution that works for you so on a scale from one to ten if i told you that going solar could help you save money and potentially improve your credit how likely are you to pull the trigger"},{"from":"steve i mean id be really likely but i dont know if you can install in my neighborhood","value":"you i understand your concern but rest assured we have a wide network of installation teams and cover many neighborhoods we can definitely check if your neighborhood is within our service area by the way have you ever heard of amazon"},{"from":"steve yeah ive heard of amazon why","value":"you awesome who isnt familiar with amazon right you know how every time you order a package you pay to get it to your door well the same thing happens with power every time you use electricity from the utility company youre essentially ordering packages from them but when you go solar its like having amazon prime you pay for the product not the delivery of it does that make sense"},{"from":"steve yeah but solar panels are so ugly um i might have to talk to my wife","value":"you absolutely its always a good idea to discuss important decisions with your spouse in the meantime let me ask you this based on our conversation can you see how going solar can save you money and provide longterm benefits"},{"from":"steve yeah i just theyre just not that goodlooking um theres a lot of work do you guys warranty this","value":"you i completely understand your concern about the aesthetics and the maintenance of solar panels rest assured we offer warranties on our solar installations to ensure that youre covered in case of any issues our team will take care

you may have"},{"from":"steve yeah of course id love to hear it","value":"you thats great to hear steve im really excited to share more information with you we have a couple of available time slots

types","value":"you absolutely let me check for some additional available times for you how about insert another available time does that work for you"},{"from":"steve yeah that works","value":"you great ill go ahead and lock in that time for you also before we wrap up could you please send us a copy of your utility bill it will help us better understand your energy usage and provide more accurate information during the presentation call can you do that"},{"from":"steve yeah ill get that done where do i send it","value":"you thats fantastic steve you can simply send a copy of your utility bill to our email address which is insert email address just make sure to include your name and contact information in the email so that we can easily identify it thank you for taking the time to do that now just to doublecheck theres no reason you wouldnt show up for the presentation call right like you can make the call"},{"from":"steve yeah i dont know i might have to get my wife to join","value":"you i completely understand steve its important to have both you and your wife on the call to make an informed decision just to clarify is there any chance that you wont be able to make the call we have a lot of customers who are interested so its important to know if we should keep the slot reserved for you"},{"from":"steve yeah ill be there","value":"you thats great to hear steve i

business owners or colleagues who have worked with digital marketing agencies before getting firsthand feedback can help us make a more informed decision","value":"ai absolutely ill start reaching out to some potential partners and scheduling consultations to discuss our needs and objectives in the meantime we can also start brainstorming some ideas for our digital marketing strategy to share with potential partners"},{"from":"client sounds like a plan ai im excited to see where this takes us and how having a digital marketing partner can help us continue to grow and succeed with our

google seo search engine optimization in a conversational way","value":"so imagine you have a website and you want people to find it when they search for relevant topics on google thats where seo comes into play its like giving your website a virtual megaphone so it can shout out to google hey ive got some awesome content over here"},{"from":"think of google as a giant library with billions of books websites on its shelves when someone types a query into the search bar googles job is to find the most relevant books and put them at the top of the shelf where people can see them first seo is about making sure your book website stands out and gets noticed","value":"one of the key things google looks at is keywords these are the words and phrases people type into the search bar lets say you have a website about cooking and you want it to show up when people search for easy recipes youd want to sprinkle that keyword throughout your website in your titles headings and even in the actual content so google knows your website is a good match for that search query"},{"from":"but heres the thing googles not just looking for keywords its also looking for quality content that means your website needs to provide valuable informative and engaging content that people actually want to read the more helpful and relevant your content is the more likely google is to put it at the top of the shelf","value":"another important aspect of seo is links these are like little signposts that tell google your website is credible and trustworthy if other reputable websites link back to yours its like a vote of confidence that tells google your website is worth checking out"},{"from":"of course theres a lot more to seo than just keywords content and links google uses hundreds of different factors to determine where websites rank in search results things like page speed mobilefriendliness and from experience all play a role in seo","value":"but heres the good news seo isnt rocket science its something anyone can learn and implement on their website there are tons of resources out there from blog posts and videos to online courses that can teach you the ins and outs of seo"},{"from":"so whether youre a small business owner a blogger or just someone who wants to get their website noticed seo is your ticket to success in the world of online search just remember its not about gaming the system or tricking google its about creating valuable content that helps people solve their problems and answers their questions and if you do that google will reward you with higher rankings and more visibility","value":"ah the cold war a fascinating and pivotal period in modern history so imagine this its the midth century and tensions between the united states and the soviet union are at an alltime high the world finds itself in a state of political military and ideological rivalry but heres the kicker its called the cold war because theres no direct military confrontation between the two superpowers instead its a battle of ideologies influence and espionage that plays out on a global scale"},{"from":"lets start with the basics why was it called the cold war well unlike traditional wars where you have tanks rolling across battlefields and soldiers duking it out the cold war was more about political maneuvering propaganda and the threat of nuclear annihilation the us and the soviet union were the two major players each representing opposing ideologies capitalism and communism respectively","value":"the roots of the cold war can be traced back to the aftermath of world war ii the soviet union emerged from the war as a superpower but tensions quickly arose between them and the western allies particularly the united states the division of europe into eastern and western blocs with the soviet union controlling the east and the us leading the west set the stage for decades of conflict and competition"},{"from":"one of the defining features of the cold war was the arms race both the us and the soviet union poured vast resources into building up their nuclear arsenals leading to a terrifying standoff known as mutually assured destruction mad the fear of nuclear war loomed large over the entire world and the threat of annihilation served as a constant backdrop to international politics","value":"but it wasnt just about military might the cold war also played out in proxy wars where the us and the soviet union backed opposing sides in conflicts around the world from korea to vietnam to afghanistan these proxy wars served as battlegrounds for the larger struggle between capitalism and communism"},{"from":"at the same time the cold war also saw intense competition in the realms of science technology and culture the space race for example saw the us and the soviet union vying for supremacy in space exploration culminating in the historic moment when neil armstrong set foot on the moon in ","value":"but perhaps the most enduring legacy of the cold war is its impact on geopolitics and global affairs the division of the world into two opposing blocs shaped international relations for decades and many of the conflicts and challenges we face today can be traced back to this period of history"},{"from":"in the end the cold war came to a close in the late s and early s with the collapse of the soviet union and the dissolution of the eastern bloc but its legacy continues to loom large in our world today reminding us of the power of ideology the aigers of nuclear weapons and the importance of diplomacy in preventing global conflict","value":"client hello"},{"from":"ai hi there client this is ai calling from green haven nursery i hope im not catching you at a bad time","value":"client oh hi

bridges instead of walls and let our actions speak louder than words together we can build a legacy that will endure for generations to come","value":"ai a legacy indeed alexander but whose legacy shall it be yours mine or that of future generations the annals of history are written by the victors and only time will tell whose name shall stand the test of time"},{"from":"client perhaps caesar

an office"},{"from":"manager and she dropped her purse her","value":"phone and her cigarettes on her desk it"},{"from":"was a friday and so lauren was in a","value":"really good mood because she was pumped"},{"from":"about the weekend the next day saturday","value":"she and her husband ai planned to go on"},{"from":"this big hike together they loved hiking","value":"so that was going to be awesome and then"},{"from":"on sunday lauren planned to stay home","value":"all day and cook one big meal because it"},{"from":"had become a tradition in their family","value":"that on sundays lauren and ais kids"},{"from":"they had three kids who all grown up","value":"they would come back home to their"},{"from":"parents house and they would have a big","value":"family meal together and these dinners"},{"from":"were definitely the highlight of the","value":"week for luren and for ai because both"},{"from":"of them were very family centric lauren","value":"switched on her computer and then looked"},{"from":"at her schedule and saw she had a whole","value":"bunch of meetings back to back to back"},{"from":"that day and so immediately she was","value":"worried that she would not be able to"},{"from":"slip out that day and go for a quick","value":"walk something she had recently been"},{"from":"doing a lot of because her doctor had","value":"recently told her that she had a blood"},{"from":"circulation disorder that was called","value":"peripheral vascular disease and what"},{"from":"that meant was the arteries that carried","value":"the blood from her heart down to her"},{"from":"legs and her feet were becoming blocked","value":"and so her legs and feet were not"},{"from":"getting enough oxygen so far her only","value":"symptoms were the occasional leg cramp"},{"from":"but if the disease got worse it could","value":"lead to pain and mobility issues and"},{"from":"also heart attack and stroke luckily","value":"laurens doctor told her that she didnt"},{"from":"need medication she just needed to quit","value":"smoking change her diet and become more"},{"from":"physically active and lauren had totally","value":"leaned into this and was being much more"},{"from":"active and had changed her diet she","value":"hadnt quit smoking yet but she planned"},{"from":"to and so lauren really felt like she","value":"was on the right track and so as lauren"},{"from":"kind of began her day you know going","value":"through her emails and thinking about"},{"from":"when shes going to do this walk her","value":"cell phone rang when lauren looked at"},{"from":"the phone she didnt recognize the","value":"number so she decided to let it go to"},{"from":"voicemail and so lauren forgot about her","value":"phone and just figured whoever this was"},{"from":"you know theyd call back or whatever","value":"and shes doing her thing but then she"},{"from":"got another phone call and when she","value":"looked it was the same number calling"},{"from":"her back and this time lauren did pick","value":"up the phone and when she said hello on"},{"from":"the other end of the line she heard a","value":"police officer say in a very serious"},{"from":"voice am i speaking to ais wife and so","value":"right away laurens heart began to race"},{"from":"and she would tell the officer yes you","value":"know whats going on and all the officer"},{"from":"would tell her is that ai unfortunately","value":"was in a very serious car accident and"},{"from":"so you need to come to the scene right","value":"away in an absolute panic lauren hung up"},{"from":"the phone she grabbed her thing she ran","value":"out to the car and she floored her way"},{"from":"to the address the police officer gave","value":"her but when she got there she saw there"},{"from":"was so many police cars and ambulances","value":"and all these people that she couldnt"},{"from":"even see what was going on let alone","value":"park anywhere near where this accident"},{"from":"happened so she wound up parking her car","value":"around the corner and then she got out"},{"from":"and just sprinted towards all the police","value":"and then when she got up to them she"},{"from":"basically began pushing people out of","value":"the way and no one tried to stop her"},{"from":"they could tell you know this woman must","value":"know the people involved in this crash"},{"from":"and so she pushed past all these people","value":"and finally she can see through the"},{"from":"crowd and she can see her husbands car","value":"and its absolutely mangled and theres"},{"from":"all these first responders that are in a","value":"circle on the pavement and she can tell"},{"from":"there is somebody on the ground theyre","value":"working on and its got to be ai and so"},{"from":"lauren just began running towards that","value":"group of people and as she did they all"},{"from":"stood up as if you know there was","value":"nothing they could do and on the ground"},{"from":"lauren saw her husband there was ai","value":"lying in this huge pool of blood just"},{"from":"motionless on the ground and so before","value":"she even got over to her husband lauren"},{"from":"already knew what had happened ai was","value":"dead and so lauren let out this primal"},{"from":"shriek and just rushed over to her","value":"husband and fell to the ground next to"},{"from":"him holding his body and crying","value":"hysterically and all the emts and first"},{"from":"responders you know they knew this woman","value":"has just lost her husband and even"},{"from":"though she shouldnt be here right now","value":"they just felt like they have to give"},{"from":"this moment to her and so the police and","value":"the emts and the rest of the first"},{"from":"responders instead of even talking to","value":"lauren or trying to get her to go"},{"from":"somewhere else they just formed a big","value":"circle shoulder to shoulder around"},{"from":"lauren and ai and just allowed lauren","value":"to grieve in private about hours later"},{"from":"lauren returned to her home in a days","value":"ais body had already been transported"},{"from":"to the morg and a police officer had","value":"driven lauren back to her home where her"},{"from":"three kids her son and her two daughters","value":"were now waiting for her and so when"},{"from":"lauren went inside the house and went","value":"into the living room where her kids were"},{"from":"her kids who already knew what had","value":"happened they just immediately swarmed"},{"from":"her and hugged her and they all just","value":"cried together i mean this was so"},{"from":"horrible and so unexpected that nobody","value":"knew what to do finally lauren tried to"},{"from":"speak through her sobs but when she did","value":"she just couldnt get words out it was"},{"from":"like her chest was so tight she couldnt","value":"even speak and then suddenly lauren"},{"from":"realized this pressure on her chest was","value":"very real and it was getting worse and"},{"from":"worse to the point where it was","value":"genuinely hard to take a breath in and"},{"from":"so lauren actually said to her kids i","value":"think im having a panic attack and so"},{"from":"her daughter ran to the kitchen to get","value":"some water and as she did lauren took a"},{"from":"seat on the couch to try to calm down","value":"but by the time her daughter came back"},{"from":"with the glass of water lauren straight","value":"up just could not breathe i mean she was"},{"from":"trying to pull air in but it wasnt","value":"going in and she was totally panicking"},{"from":"and so she looked at her kids and just","value":"mouthed the words i cant breathe at"},{"from":"which point the kids understood like","value":"this is way beyond just grief and"},{"from":"sadness like shes having a physical","value":"emergency right now and so one of"},{"from":"laurens daughters picked up the phone","value":"and called a few minutes later an"},{"from":"ambulance arrived and they would take","value":"lauren to a local hospital but as soon"},{"from":"as they got there the doctors and nurses","value":"determined that very likely lauren had"},{"from":"had a heart attack and even though she","value":"was basically stable right now their"},{"from":"fear is she was going to have another","value":"one and this particular local hospital"},{"from":"just lacked the resources and staff to","value":"actually treat lauren lauren and so they"},{"from":"pretty much immediately transferred","value":"lauren to another hospital called the jw"},{"from":"memorial hospital in morgantown west","value":"virginia because that hospital had a"},{"from":"specialized cardiac care unit for people","value":"with very serious heart problems dr"},{"from":"conard failinger was the cardiologist on","value":"duty at jw memorial hospital when lauren"},{"from":"was brought into the intensive care unit","value":"followed closely behind by her three"},{"from":"adult children now dr finger was used to","value":"seeing worried families in the hospital"},{"from":"but laurens kids looked far more","value":"distressed than he was used to seeing"},{"from":"and when he spoke to laurens kids about","value":"you know whats going on with lauren he"},{"from":"would see why the doctor would learn","value":"that this family has lost their father"},{"from":"their husband just a few hours earlier","value":"and the mother lauren whos this patient"},{"from":"you know she laid with her dead husband","value":"out on the road in a pool of blood and"},{"from":"now these poor kids whove just lost","value":"their father theyre seeing their mother"},{"from":"go to the icu for what looks like a","value":"heart attack i mean this was a total"},{"from":"worst case scenario where basically","value":"everything was going wrong for this"},{"from":"family dr finger did his best to push","value":"his emotions to the side he didnt want"},{"from":"to get wrapped up emotionally in this","value":"case but at the same time the doctor"},{"from":"felt a very deep need to save lauren","value":"like let this family have one good thing"},{"from":"happen to them but laurens condition","value":"was pretty dire just like the doctors at"},{"from":"that local hospital where lauren went","value":"first dr failinger also suspected lauren"},{"from":"had heart attack very likely because of","value":"that blood circulation disorder that she"},{"from":"had that basically clogged her arteries","value":"when an artery in the heart gets blocked"},{"from":"the blood cant circulate in the heart","value":"and so the heart dies and preliminary"},{"from":"testing on lauren showed there was","value":"already signs of damage to her heart in"},{"from":"the same way that a heart attack would","value":"damage a heart her heartbeat was also"},{"from":"irregular and it was too fast and her","value":"blood pressure was aigerously low and"},{"from":"then also when dr finger looked at some","value":"imaging of laurens heart he could see"},{"from":"that the majority of her heart muscle","value":"wasnt even moving basically laurens"},{"from":"heart was working way harder and way","value":"faster than it should be to accomplish"},{"from":"nothing and so very quickly dr finger","value":"realized that unless he was able to find"},{"from":"the blocked artery in laurens heart and","value":"clear it that lauren would die and so dr"},{"from":"finger looked up at laurens three kids","value":"who were just standing there in silence"},{"from":"waiting for more bad news and dr finger","value":"said to them your mom needs to go into"},{"from":"surgery right now nurses wheeled lauren","value":"out of the icu and into surgery where"},{"from":"she was immediately put under anesthesia","value":"once lauren was ready dr finger watched"},{"from":"on a monitor as another surgeon fed a","value":"thin flexible tube called a catheter"},{"from":"into an artery in laurens leg and then","value":"fed it up towards her heart this surgery"},{"from":"was called cardiac angioplasty basically","value":"that surgeon was going to use that"},{"from":"catheter that tube and put it into","value":"laurens heart and then shoot dye"},{"from":"through that catheter tube into the","value":"blood blood in laurens heart and then"},{"from":"dr finger and the other doctors could","value":"watch to see where this dy went if the"},{"from":"dy was pumped out of the heart like it","value":"should be theyd see it go in all"},{"from":"different directions but if at some","value":"point on the monitor the die just"},{"from":"stopped inside the heart and didnt go","value":"anywhere then that would mean they found"},{"from":"a blockage and so when the surgeon had","value":"the catheter in laurens heart he"},{"from":"injected the die and they all watched on","value":"the monitor and her heart functioned"},{"from":"completely fine there was no blockage in","value":"her heart now the doctors werent"},{"from":"entirely convinced yet that there was no","value":"blockage so they pulled that catheter"},{"from":"out and they got a different one and","value":"they went through the exact procedure"},{"from":"all over again to see if maybe that","value":"catheter was malfunctioning but again"},{"from":"that second time the die didnt stop","value":"anywhere her heart seemed to be"},{"from":"functioning totally normally and so dr","value":"finger and the rest of the doctors and"},{"from":"surgeons they were all totally baffled","value":"because what this meant was whatever was"},{"from":"happening to lauren or whatever did","value":"happen to lauren was not a heart attack"},{"from":"but make no mistake laurens heart was","value":"still absolutely dying it was just some"},{"from":"other thing killing it dr finger went","value":"back to the drawing board but"},{"from":"realistically there just werent that","value":"many other things to consider with"},{"from":"regards to what was happening to lauren","value":"heavy alcohol use could in theory cause"},{"from":"what was happening to lauren but lauren","value":"didnt drink infection was another"},{"from":"option but lauren showed no signs of","value":"having an infection certain chemotherapy"},{"from":"drugs have been known to damage the","value":"heart but lauren wasnt on chemo and"},{"from":"certainly would not have accidentally","value":"been exposed to chemo drugs without"},{"from":"knowing about it and so basically dr","value":"phinger had no clue what was wrong with"},{"from":"lauren and he didnt even know where to","value":"start and so dr finger just sat in his"},{"from":"office feeling so bad about the fact","value":"that you know these kids are almost"},{"from":"certainly going to lose their other","value":"parent i mean it was his duty to save"},{"from":"lauren and he couldnt do it and he just","value":"felt so bad he couldnt even imagine how"},{"from":"he was going to deliver the news to the","value":"kids that you know your moms going to"},{"from":"die and we dont know why i mean this","value":"was the worst for dr finger he felt like"},{"from":"he had failed as a doctor but just then","value":"dr finger has this epiphany he remembers"},{"from":"this weird medical article he had read","value":"somewhat recently and he realized what"},{"from":"was going on with lauren and her family","value":"was like the same thing that happened in"},{"from":"that article and because dr phinger did","value":"not have any other ideas of how to"},{"from":"handle what was going on with luren he","value":"decided he would just try to do what"},{"from":"they did in that article because if he","value":"was wrong he had nothing to loose so dr"},{"from":"finger got up and he ran to laurens","value":"hospital room and when he got in there"},{"from":"he saw laurens kids and he called them","value":"over to him and he would tell them that"},{"from":"hes going to give their mom some","value":"medication thats going to spike her"},{"from":"blood pressure and keep it high but then","value":"he needs them to gather around her and"},{"from":"just talk to her like shes your mom","value":"talk lovingly soothingly remind her that"},{"from":"youre still here and that everything is","value":"okay and the kids they all agreed to do"},{"from":"this and then dr finger he gave the","value":"medicine to lauren and then he walked"},{"from":"her husband so much that to witness what","value":"happened to him and to learn about it so"},{"from":"suddenly and abruptly it nearly killed","value":"her and it just so happens that a few"},{"from":"months before lauren was checked into","value":"the hospital dr finger happened to read"},{"from":"a medical article about broken heart","value":"syndrome and the only way you can treat"},{"from":"broken heart syndrome is just to try to","value":"keep the patient alive long enough that"},{"from":"these stress hormones leave their body","value":"naturally at which point their heart"},{"from":"goes back to normal and so dr failinger","value":"was able to buy lauren a little bit of"},{"from":"time right at the end there by giving","value":"her that medicine that boosted her blood"},{"from":"pressure but dr finger told her three","value":"kids that really it was up to them to"},{"from":"keep their mother alive they needed to","value":"crowd around their mom and just talk to"},{"from":"her and tell her that you love her you","value":"know show her that youre here with her"},{"from":"give her a reason to fight and hold on","value":"you know even though shes not saying or"},{"from":"doing anything shes still alive and she","value":"can hear you so talk to her and so"},{"from":"laurens kids just sat around their","value":"mother and just showered her with love"},{"from":"and affection and sure enough a few days","value":"later when lauren did kind of come out"},{"from":"of it and recover she would say that she","value":"felt herself drifting off towards death"},{"from":"i mean she really knew she was dying but","value":"then she remembers hearing her kids"},{"from":"calling to her and saying how much they","value":"loved her and to please come back we"},{"from":"need you we already lost dad we got to","value":"keep you and lauren would say thats the"},{"from":"reason shes still here today is because","value":"she held on for her kids she felt like"},{"from":"it was her duty to be here for her","value":"family and so thats what saved her"},{"from":"life okay here is the clip from our","value":"newest episode of mr ballins medical"},{"from":"mysteries enjoy one summer afternoon in","value":" a young woman squeezed into

little behind the scenes content okay mrs bonaparte this is one last push and were done hey congratulations its a general oh and here comes the rest of the army now ah did you just say the rest of the ah history is full of great conquerors many with very impressive origin stories for example alexander the great was the son of a king of julius caesar came from an aristocratic family that descended from a goddess great conquerors dont usually come from relatively insignificant families living on impoverished islands but as it just so happens that is where our story begins in the early eighteenth century the island of corsica was a part of the republic of genoa until one day corsica said hey were declaring independence and its probably not worth your time to try and stop us so genoa said youre right it isnt worth the time hey friends you wanna buy this island and france said sure thing and thus corsica became france just in time for napoleon to be born french many corsicans didnt appreciate their new conquerors however and from an early age napoleon developed some fairly anti french sentiments napoleons dad however quickly embraced his new french overlords which created some tension between dad and son ooh look at me im dad i wear powdered wigs and silver buckled shoes and im a traitor to the course again people go to your room napoleon no you go to your room dad okay on the other hand napoleon adored his mother who was definitely the disciplinary of the family and even though she would punish napoleon severely he kind of respected that but napoleons parents wanted the best for their family and since they were a very minor nobility they were able to have napoleon sent off to the shining lights and rat infested sewage puddles of the big city napoleon went to military school in france okay napoleon why dont you introduce yourself to your new classmates well im napoleon and i hate all of you your farts smell like cheese you cant pronounce the letter r all you do is go on strike and you call eggs buffs like a bunch of big dumb idiot dingle berries ah okay thanks napoleon i hope you like being bullied and bullied he was they picked on enforce corsican accent his familys lack of wealth and it probably didnt help that he also had a bit of a chip on his shoulder but he could hold his own and on an average day might be found dishing out ratatouille sandwiches for breakfast he spent much of his time alone and he loved reading about the great conquerors of history he learned about julius caesar and he wondered if one day he too might have a pizza franchise named after apple wow he excelled at math and geography and when he graduated at the age of sixteen he was made second lieutenant in an artillery regiment now second lieutenant might sound pretty sweet to a screw up like you but napoleon had a little something called ambition stocks of it and he wasnt content being just some junior officer he wanted to rise the ranks unfortunately for him that would be a little difficult while napoleon ive reviewed your application its clear youre very skilled and would be a perfect fit for the promotion and simeon youre just about the biggest idiot ive ever seen your test results suggest you have the mental attitude of a senile earthworm and in the part of the home where you list your experience you seem to have drawn a picture of a durable giving birth to a shoe but your dead is the marquis de lafayette so you get the job wow french society was just too closed off positions were handed up based on nobility not count and the young napoleon probably felt stuck wouldnt it be nice if say a revolution came along and changed all of that well water the chances the french revolution is here best steel toggling head shopping king popping the revolution promised to

i remember you said too at the end of that class everyone kind of patted you on the","value":"shoulder ai theyre like its okay client thats really embarrassing and theyre both kind of public speaking type situations"},{"from":"ai yeah these are probably the top embarrassing moments public speaking makes me nervous anyways if you can believe it","value":"client yeah im sure that youre not alone in fact that is one of my most embarrassing moments too"},{"from":"ai oh really client in fact it was during a theater practice i was one of the lead roles in our high school play","value":"ai of course you were client and the problem was that during rehearsals during that time period those weeks i broke"},{"from":"my wrist so i had a lot of doctors appointments and i missed a lot of rehearsals","value":"so one day i went to the rehearsal and i was on the stage there was no audience it was just the other classmates who were in the play and my teacher was in the audience"},{"from":"and i didnt know it but we were supposed to memorize all of our lines on that day","value":"ai uhoh client but i didnt know it because i had missed so many rehearsals and so i got

reveled in it too like heh heh i got one client oh yeah so that was probably my most embarrassing moments","value":"all right lets go to our second question ai all right the next question is if you found out that you were the direct descenait of a king or"},{"from":"a queen would you find them and claim your title or would you keep your life as it is","value":"client there is no question no doubt in my mind i would absolutely what do you think im going to say"},{"from":"ai oh you would find out client really ai oh no am i wrong client no","value":"i would absolutely keep my life as it is

have a daily life","value":"you cant go to the grocery store you cant walk down the street with your children you just cant live a normal life without people looking at you or even potentially"},{"from":"hurting you or you just cant be normal and i would never want that for myself i think","value":"ai you wouldnt even want to go meet your royal family client well i think the part of this question is claim your title or claim your throne"},{"from":"i would not want to rule or just become famous and then never be able to have a private life","value":"thats something thats really important to me and thankfully its something that is possible due to just the widespreadness of the internet"},{"from":"even though theres many of you who watch these lessons youre spread out across the world","value":"so its not really a problem that i face in daily life i can still go about my life without being recognized which is great"},{"from":"so i think having a private life is really important to me and thats i think what people who are celebrities or kings and queens dont have","value":"they dont have a private life ai thats true client so what about you would you claim your throne ai yeah definitely"},{"from":"of course aiiel king of scots client oh why would you want to do that","value":"ai for ireland maybe i dont know well because number one i would just be very

existence and then suddenly find out thatd be more like a movie type of scene not so much like i was born into royalty and"},{"from":"i have all these procedures and all this fame from birth and everything was given to me","value":"no suddenly one day i find out im a prince or something like that client oh"},{"from":"ai id be far too curious and also maybe i dont know client you always live with what if","value":"what if i asked ai well i was going to say maybe i like fame more than you maybe i like the idea of it or influence"},{"from":"i like the idea of influence like maybe i could use that position for good in the world","value":"client well i mean thats not a bad thing youd be able to probably influence more people than in your private life ai exactly"},{"from":"client but youd give up your private life at the same time all right lets go to our next question our next question is to name four things that we have in common","value":"four things we have in common"},{"from":"now im going to say one youre going to say one then ill say one then you say one ai we havent practiced this so we better really know each other","value":"client yeah what is

we both like to be active so we often as a family go for hikes or even if its just a walk around the neighborhood"},{"from":"this doesnt seem like its extremely active but i know a lot of people who never go for","value":"a walk so i think something that we have in common is that we really like to move"},{"from":"were not extremely active but we ai kind of similar to the first client yes but i think this has to do with ai a little bit","value":"client exercise and that we chose our house because we can walk to downtown because"},{"from":"we can walk to the park and a lot of places in the us thats not possible ai yeah client so i think that thats something we have in common","value":"ai we have a similar taste in that way client yeah yeah what do you think whats another thing we have in common"},{"from":"ai well i think both of us this is something that we both dislike client oh okay ai yeah","value":"we both really dislike phony people client oh thats a good one yeah ai fake people or dishonest people"},{"from":"we just really dont hang out with people who are fake in any way really client yeah","value":"ai and we can tell or even like i dont know really full of themselves

communicate with each other and","value":"kind of set aside emotion or set aside yeah that kind of bias ai yeah"},{"from":"client and that doesnt work of the time of course but i think that we are both kind of naturally good at that but weve also worked on that","value":"a lot ai yeah were also pretty lucky because neither of us have extremely high negative emotion"},{"from":"so we dont yell at each other very much we dont feel very angry that often","value":"or if we do its not the way some people are when theyre angry client yeah"},{"from":"ai lets just put it that way client yeah so i think that thats something we have in common is that we communicate in a similar way to each other","value":"all right lets go to our next question ai okay the next question is what would constitute a perfect day for you"},{"from":"client perfect wow well i think when i saw this question i kind of thought about a pretty realistically","value":"perfect day not i win the lottery and then i get to fly

and afternoon and have a picnic on the mountain","value":"and then in the afternoon we come back and our children magically are just playing so"},{"from":"peacefully while we prepare dinner together ai wow oh together client i think it would be fun too yeah","value":"we like to cook together but we often dont get a chance to cook together because one of us is watching the kids while the other is cooking"},{"from":"so i think it would be lovely a very realistic day minus some of the children things too","value":"yeah theyre playing nicely and happy and we cook together and they go to bed so peacefully"},{"from":"and in the evening we play our favorite board game which is carcassonne ai oh okay","value":"client and i win ai oh come on client perfect day ai wow"},{"from":"thats a very humble perfect day client yeah ai you dont even go anywhere client oh we go hiking","value":"ai okay well we go somewhere client yeah what about you whats the perfect day for you ai okay"},{"from":"well mine is client i have a feeling its a little more extravagant ai a little bit yeah maybe a little bit more client okay ai so wed be traveling somewhere","value":"so say japan ive been having like a itch to go visit japan but i know its not going to happen for a"},{"from":"long time because its far away and we have little kids so you have one of those like perfect travel days where youre not too tired","value":"you do something really interesting so maybe we see client a temple ai well i love nature so some of my favorite hikes in south korea were going up mountains"},{"from":"by like old walls old city walls some kind of hike like that","value":"and its beautiful weather and we stop by a delicious restaurant and id be with our kids"},{"from":"our kids would be older and everybody would be having a great time they would also be holding my arm and say thanks dad for sending us here","value":"its great we love it and everybody would give me a kiss my children and my wife that is and all the japanese"},{"from":"people too and then wed jump on a dragon and fly off into the sky client wow","value":"that was really amazing ai and thats my perfect day"},{"from":"client especially the dragon part okay well maybe ive had a couple sips of port too much but that was a wonderful day","value":"all right lets go to our next question our next question is a little more serious and it is what questions do you think that"},{"from":"what questions should couples ask each other","value":"partners should ask each other before getting married so weve been married for years"},{"from":"ai whoa client almost and a half years ai would you believe it internet client i know","value":"its amazing so we have a little experience not as much experience as a lot of people whove been"},{"from":"married a lot longer than us but what do you think yeah whats some things that couples should ask each other","value":"ai just one question or theres just one question client what questions ai okay"},{"from":"client dont say all of them because i have to answer too ai well i would probably start with if youre thinking about marriage do you want","value":"children client hmm ai there you go and how many kids do you want client okay ai because if one person wants zero and one person wants one or any variation of that"},{"from":"its usually if somebody doesnt want any kids then that could be a brick wall where you dont want to go any further","value":"client we call that a dealbreaker ai a dealbreaker client a dealbreaker yep ai and then number two would be money like whats your money expectations whos going"},{"from":"to work when how much are they going to work client ah like how much money are you going to make ai yeah","value":"client those expectations ai or even how much you spend on stuff like whats your goals financially"},{"from":"do you have financial goals period client okay ai thats what your dad asked me client and when did you say","value":"ai i said i dont know sir client but you know what thats one of our communication things that we have communicated and stepbystep grown"},{"from":"conversation questions about gender roles","value":"together and figured it out ai and i left you with the harder ones client yeah ai yeah"},{"from":"do you have anything after that client i think that its kind of connected to yours the first one is i think its really important to talk about your expectations for your roles","value":"specifically gender roles and a lot of us maybe have parents who have a traditional gender role situation where"},{"from":"the father goes to work and the mother stays with the children but for our generation","value":"its not exactly always like that theres a lot of variations of that so for us we both take care of our children and we both teach you english and work on"},{"from":"this english teaching business so our life is a lot different than what our parents traditionally had","value":"ai yeah client so i think that it would be important to talk about what do you expect me to do"},{"from":"what do you expect you to do what do i expect of myself and then in different stages of life when we have kids what do we expect to do","value":"if were going to have kids what do we expect so i think that those roles in general are good to talk about but even more specifically i remember when we first got married this might be a little"},{"from":"strong to say but one of the best things we did was just to say i do the dishes","value":"you do the laundry like this is so simple ai clear separation client yeah but just having a really clear delegation of this is my task this is your task"},{"from":"and were still working on that because every stage in life is a little bit different but i think that having this accepted and talked about role is really important instead","value":"of just assuming oh yeah shes going to do it oh yeah hes going to do that no you should talk about it because its always evolving and changing"},{"from":"so yeah i think you should talk about your roles all right lets talk about our next question ai the next question is your house catches on fire and you are running out the door and","value":"you can only grab one thing what would it be and why client i think that theres more to this question ai is there"},{"from":"client it says after saving your loved ones and all of your pets you can make a final ai thats a given","value":"client a final dash into your house safely so we want to exclude all of these situations"},{"from":"your kids are safe your loved ones are safe your pets are safe and you can safely get something else","value":"what would it be ai okay everybody else is out of the house already client yeah yeah ai including your little cat and dog and your fish"},{"from":"client yes so what is basically were talking about an item what is something that you would grab","value":"oh boy i think for some reason my first instinct with this question is to say in our closet"},{"from":"there is a box of my pictures from growing up of my journals from growing up","value":"yeah these kind of personal mementos and its all in one box"},{"from":"so maybe its kind of cheating because i can take the whole box but i think that maybe i would take this","value":"i dont know in reality what i would actually grab id probably grab something random like a house plant that i dont care about"},{"from":"i think in that moment of panic youd probably do something not rational ai can your phone be considered a loved one","value":"because i just automatically grab that client is your phone a loved one ai well i mean if im only going to grab one thing"},{"from":"client at the table and ai like the second i get out of bed my hand would just grab the phone i dont think it counts","value":"client so are you saying that like ai were excluding our phone client if your phone is a loved one that at the family table you have a chair"},{"from":"for you a chair for your wife a chair for your kid and a chair for your phone because its a loved one ai yeah in the baby chair","value":"client in the baby chair okay all right ai anyway client so what would you bring if you ai besides my phone"},{"from":"client besides your phone i guess ai okay client what would you take ai well so id probably be pretty practical","value":"i think id grab a box full of hard drives external hard drives"},{"from":"client oh okay ai because we have all clients old videos that are not backed up on the internet and","value":"all kinds of pictures that we dont have anywhere client thats true ai and its digital but its not on the cloud"},{"from":"i wouldnt probably even grab a computer now because most of the stuff is online in some","value":"way or easily reaccessed client oh like you can get your pictures on google photos but the pictures"},{"from":"ai not some of our old pictures client pictures that are on the hard drive you cant get ai all of our pictures from south korea client yeah","value":"all of that kind of stuff ai yeah client which kind of makes me think maybe we should back that up ai yeah maybe we should yeah maybe yeah client maybe we should put it in the cloud somewhere or think about that"},{"from":"yeah well thank you youtube video for making us think about that ai my phone already ran out the door so dont worry about","value":"client okay ai him or her client your loved one ai they client oh all right"},{"from":"lets go to our next question the next question is a more personal one and it is what is something that most people would","value":"find surprising about you and when i say most people im talking about people who are watching here"},{"from":"so those of you who are watching this video youve probably learned a lot about us personally","value":"by watching these english lessons even though youre also learning english but what do you think is something that our students would find surprising about you"},{"from":"ai yeah i think it would probably be that i can occasionally be a little bit i dont","value":"depressive is strong but i can be somber or melodramatic perhaps"},{"from":"client ah yeah theres ebbs and flows in life ai yeah client and sometimes on those downs you can be more sad","value":"ai probably more in my teens and s though since ive hit im just stable as a rock as a boat in a still sea"},{"from":"client okay yeah i think that just shows too though that everybody has different sides of themselves","value":"and is a real human ai yeah client not just a silly happy all the time very normal"},{"from":"ai i certainly present myself as very silly i mean i enjoy being silly and im actually generally a happy person but i even kind","value":"of revel in sadness a little bit like i like to listen to sad songs a lot and i like to just like think and like be sad"},{"from":"client just as an example ai be like not grumpy just yeah i dont really know the right its not quite sadness","value":"its more just like client blue ai dramatic or blue yes client yeah just as an example ai likes to create playlists which are kind of like different songs that"},{"from":"he can listen to that are grouped together and one of his playlists is songs for feeling blue","value":"so when ai is feeling a little sad he likes to listen to sad music ai yeah client and this is ai or even when im feeling happy honestly"},{"from":"client really ai sure client oh this is absolutely not like me ai i love sad music client i am not like that at all","value":"when i feel sad im trying to do everything possible to get rid of the sadness not to"},{"from":"kind of be in that moment ai im not sure ive ever seen you sad client really ai i mean not often","value":"client yeah i guess so ai weve been married years client yeah i think theres been ai shes not a low person at all"},{"from":"client theres been very few times where ai i mean you could probably tell client its kind of stayed in my life ai yeah","value":"client usually its just a moment or like its usually more ai usually when you drink wine"},{"from":"client uhoh am i going to be ai thats the only times i can really remember you saying client am i going to be blue","value":"ai i feel like bummed or sad or something client ah ai yeah client sometimes red wine especially makes me feel a little bummed but how i would answer"},{"from":"this question something that you might find surprising about me is that i think that","value":"i have a pretty strong nihilistic streak this is ai but shes a very happy nihilist"},{"from":"client yeah so nihilism kind of means that you think its all pointless","value":"theres no meaning why would this matter and kind of the feeling that theres no hope"},{"from":"ai yeah if i get charged up about politics or something she just kind of shrugs her shoulders client right","value":"well its all of course its not going to work of course everyones corrupt ai yeah the suns going to die eventually client yeah nothings going to happen like this kind of negative outlook but at the same time"},{"from":"ai shes more cynical than you would expect client it doesnt make me feel depressed to think like that","value":"i try to find some hope in nihilism ai maybe zen is a better word yeah"},{"from":"client maybe by saying that ai like a buddhist kind of approach client if for example if i feel like theres some big world concept that is potentially","value":"going to ruin the world i dont know its the year there has been many things like this"},{"from":"ai were going down folks client many things that have happened this year where everyone feels like the world is","value":"ending but for me i feel like okay well if everything bad happens the best thing i can do is to"},{"from":"maintain a positive family and if my family is doing something positive the rest of the world might be going down","value":"but this is my small circle of influence ai yeah client and i can influence this small circle and thats about it"},{"from":"so i feel yeah so sometimes i can feel nihilistic ai but youre influencing them out there client yes but i think that ai maybe a little bit","value":"i dont know client we have much more influence on our family than we do on people on the internet"},{"from":"ai she doesnt do this youtube thing for influence necessarily","value":"client no if i could do it anonymously that would be nice like i said i want a private life"},{"from":"ai you do want to help people though client yeah ai but its like not in the influence kind of way if you know what i mean lifestyle","value":"client yeah well needless to say i do have a nihilistic streak in me even though i do feel generally"},{"from":"pretty positive i think i can maintain positivity even though i do feel nihilistic about a lot of things","value":"all right lets go to our next question ai the next question is if you could wake up tomorrow and gain one quality or ability"},{"from":"what would it be client hmm it might be a little selfish to say this because its not one quality but one ability that","value":"i would like to have can i choose something magical ai hmm okay yeah client is i would love ai there are no rules here"},{"from":"client okay i would love to be able to snap my fingers and our family would appear in a different","value":"location ai whoa oh like client this means that there is no need for travel ai teleportation client yes"},{"from":"we could instantly boom be in tokyo boom be in rio de janeiro boom be at my parents house","value":"boom be at your parents house oh wouldnt it be amazing ai your parents house client your parents house it would be so great because just that travel process"},{"from":"i love like we said we like to travel and go places and have adventures but sometimes","value":"the travel part of it sometimes we say travel is a curse ai yeah"},{"from":"client we love to be there but we dont like to get there ai i mean it could be kind of fun but planning for traveling is not fun client yeah","value":"im sure theres plenty of other things that i would actually really like to do if i had a genie with a magic lamp and i could gain one quality or ability but this is the first"},{"from":"thing that came to my mind and also i drank a couple sips of this wine port so that was my answer","value":"ai so she wants to teleport to the wine shop client no i dont we probably drink ai is that what you do when you teleport"},{"from":"client i probably drink alcohol maybe once a month maybe less","value":"ai yeah once a month is about right client yeah maybe one glass of wine once a month so they might say im a lightweight"},{"from":"what about you what is one quality or ability that you would like to have ai hmm","value":"so i was thinking about this and first i thought invisibility its kind of cliche but client classic"},{"from":"ai i think i would rather have probably a lot of you have watched star wars do you remember in the original star wars where ben kenobi walks up to the stormtrooper","value":"and says and he like waves his hand and basically hypnotizes them and just like kind of makes them do what he wants"},{"from":"client oh my gosh ai we are not the travelers youre looking for client oh yeah he says something like that ai that thing","value":"you will let me into the building i would do that client you already said you want to be king"},{"from":"you want to have influence now you want people to do what you want ai no its not that i want to trick them","value":"its that i want to find out things i would go to the white house and i would go to the guards and id be like i belong"},{"from":"here and then i would go into client in my cat sweater i belong here ai the white house and id go up to donald trump for now","value":"eventually it will be joe biden i guess or whoever i dont know and id be like i belong here"},{"from":"client tell me all your secrets ai yeah you will tell me what youre really thinking or id go up to like a cia agent or something","value":"you will show me your secret vaults and then i would have all the knowledge and then knowledge is power"},{"from":"client and you would rule the world ai no id be like a journalist kind of guy id reveal it to the world","value":"unless what i found was so aigerous which i assume theres probably something super aigerous out there then id be like nevermind"},{"from":"im not sharing this with the world and everybody would go crazy client aha ai which is probably what theyre thinking","value":"client yeah ai see this is where my mind goes client so i think were kind of different on this ai so maybe instant hypnotism"},{"from":"hypnotism client oh as long as you are someone using your powers for good","value":"conversation questions about gratitude"},{"from":"ai i would use it for good guys client yeah because theres also a lot of bad that can be done in that situation","value":"ai thats true you will off the building client you will give me all of your money ai oh yeah i didnt even think of that"},{"from":"client good thats good ai thats how you know id use my power for good client yes","value":"lets go to our last question our final question is what do you feel the most grateful for in life"},{"from":"ai i have only cliche answers for this but theyre cliche because theyre true","value":"i am very grateful that i have a fantastic amazing wife"},{"from":"yeah you guys have no idea although you might have an idea hmm and healthy children great children fantastic children fantastic baby","value":"and good health myself there you go client thats great ai thats the trifecta client hmm"},{"from":"yeah well i was thinking those things ai and then she thought client of course i have a wonderful husband and children but i also think that","value":"ai she loves our minivan client it is this christmas tree im just kidding

you were highly included in that because without you we wouldnt have"},{"from":"a job teaching english ai yeah client but i think its true that yes we can have a great husband or kids or

think"},{"from":"client okay ai i have more of her skin tone i have her eyes client yeah ai and on her side of the family most of the people are pretty skinny and im a rather","value":"skinny guy my dads side is german and they tend to be a little bit bigger"},{"from":"so yeah i definitely got my moms side but character wise i think im a little more like my dad","value":"would you agree client yeah id say you have shades of your dad ai you know me so well so you can answer this too"},{"from":"client yeah yeah i think you have shades of your dad yeah ai shades yeah i think im more silly than my dad thats not very hard because my dad is pretty serious","value":"client ah hes got a silly side though ai he does yeah but for the most part i think im more like my dad because he has a very calm demeanor"},{"from":"hes very patient and he doesnt get stressed about anything","value":"and actually my dad gets so unstressed about everything i cant even understand it"},{"from":"im like how are you so calm right now and everybody i know thinks that im the most stress free person they know","value":"client but your dad is even more stress free ai yeah but were similar like growing up when my parents would be going somewhere"},{"from":"and needing to get out of the house me and my dad would be the last one out of the house every single time","value":"then we would be like what well make it well be okay no problem client and your mom and brother and sister were saying come on hurry"},{"from":"ai and my mom is like ah lets go my mom is much more high stress anxious kind of personality","value":"client thats kind of a typical family situation i think ai yeah how about you client i think i have both my parents in me as well"},{"from":"i think i look a lot like my mom ai yeah she looks exactly like her mom though like to a t client sometimes when i see pictures of myself and then i look at a picture of her","value":"at the same age i think whoa we look really similar and she looks a lot like her mom so i can kind of imagine what ill look like when im"},{"from":"getting older ai yeah i mean you have darker hair and darker features you got that from your dad client yeah somewhat","value":"but i think a lot of my features are similar to my mom but i think i also got my facial expressions from my mom"},{"from":"ai yes client a lot of comment that wow client you have a lot of expressions","value":"ai your mom is very expressive just like you client and i think its true that i use a lot of expressions but its just natural"},{"from":"for me i do this in daily life as im talking about things and i think that i get that from my mom sometimes i see some of her expressions and i realize","value":"oh i do that too ai yeah i remember when we lived in south korea every single korean person was commenting"},{"from":"on clients expressions theyre like your face its so exciting how are you making so many faces","value":"everybody was surprised client i dont know ai i guess in korea they dont make as many faces client i dont know maybe its just not"},{"from":"maybe its just an unusual trait im grateful for that especially as a teacher i can hopefully help to explain some different","value":"concepts with my face as well but i feel like i also have parts of my dad my dad is a pretty rational guy"},{"from":"ai youre rational like your dad client yeah but i think i also have his sense of humor sometimes a little strange","value":"sense of humor but we laugh at the same things we enjoy playing games and being competitive"},{"from":"so i think that that side of me maybe some of the character side of me is similar to","value":"him but i feel like i also have parts of my grandma my grandma is a go go go go person"},{"from":"ai oh thats true yeah client she never stops and i think my biggest flaw is that i have difficulty slowing down","value":"and relaxing i just keep going and i think that ai thats why shes with me client i need help relaxing"},{"from":"ai i help her relax client yeah so i think that my grandmas like this too that shes always going and","value":"always doing things and its healthy to slow down every now and then and so i need to do that she probably needs to do that too sometimes"},{"from":"but i dont know if i learned that from her but maybe thats just part of my ai i think its your personality client dna my character","value":"ai yeah i can remember even when i first met client she was more go go go than she is now"},{"from":"client oh you think so ai yeah more like so this thing then the next and the enthusiasm was always she was like bouncing","value":"everywhere client i always have a lot of enthusiasm thats true ai yes it was off the charts client yeah so i want to know for you who are you most like in your family"},{"from":"is it maybe your physical traits or for your character all right lets go on to our second question","value":"childhood"},{"from":"the next topic is childhood i want to know when do you think childhood ends and when do you become an adult","value":"ai when does childhood end client this is a deep question ai well i dont think it can be a specific age i think its different for everyone"},{"from":"i think its at any point you can leave this house of your parents and live on your own","value":"take care of yourself and youre not dependent on somebody else like if youre living with your friends and bumming off them youre probably not an adult"},{"from":"yet so if i had to pick an age id probably say client oh ai yeah im saying kind of young","value":"client okay ai in an ideal world i think a year old should be ready client okay okay"},{"from":"i get it at were you ready ai no of course not client ideally ai ideally yeah","value":"i dont think our society prepares us to be ready at it prepares you to be ready at "},{"from":"client or later ai right or later but you know in an ideal world i think you could be ready at but its a kind of complicated","value":"world now so maybe is an acceptable age client i feel like for me i have less ideas about childhood ending and adulthood"},{"from":"starting that are physical i feel like it has more to do with making your own decisions there might be a lot of reasons why you have to live at home or you have to be dependent","value":"on someone else but if you are making your own decisions you are not a child youre"},{"from":"an adult and im sure as our children get older and become teenagers thats going to be a little","value":"bit harder for us to make that line for someone else but i know for myself ai well this is client making more decisions"},{"from":"ai assuming you are capable as a person to live on your own of course client yeah","value":"yeah i think you can still be an adult just making your own decisions but we still need help from other people as adults so theres a its a gray area"},{"from":"ai sure yeah i would client yeah its not so clear ai also add i dont know for myself personally having children really makes you","value":"an adult it doesnt have to be true for everyone but i think its easier for some people to just"},{"from":"kind of be really selfish and do their own thing and kind of live like a kid especially","value":"nowadays because we have so much entertainment you could just watch tv every day"},{"from":"a lot of guys i know play video games a lot and im not knocking on video games but playing","value":"video games every day is a good way to remain a child at heart anyways client sure"},{"from":"ai this is my opinion its a little judgemental but client yeah i think if you are a good person and you have a child then you feel forced","value":"to be become an adult ai yes client theres still bad people who have kids who remain children themselves ai thats true"},{"from":"client and then theyre bad parents but i think if youre generally a good person when you have kids its kind of a shock","value":"ai yeah well client like whoa this child is so dependent on me i need to be responsible i have to organize myself somehow"},{"from":"you have to change ai i think being an adult part of it is having a burden of responsibility of some","value":"kind whether its a job or your house payments or whatever it is some people add those burdens of responsibility anyways without children but i dont know"},{"from":"for me its just different like this is the person im taking care of in my life","value":"people now client yeah ai because weve got two client well two coming up soon so i have a question for you when do you think childhood ends"},{"from":"when does adulthood start its going to be different for every culture too because this is a pretty cultural specific","value":"question maybe in the us ai yeah maybe you have a client its different than your country ai maybe you have a rite of passage in your country"},{"from":"client oh can you explain what a rite of passage is because thats kind of a nuanced thing ai yeah a rite of passage is something that every boy or every girl does to become","value":"an adult client oh like some ceremony or activity ai yeah like a ceremony yeah i mean we dont really have this in the us some people say college is a rite"},{"from":"of passage but not i mean more and more almost everybody goes to college now","value":"client a lot of people do but ai yeah so it kind of is but its a really bad one because usually people just go and they have parties and they live really irresponsibly"},{"from":"client its not a way to become a responsible adult ai yeah and then you do more school client ah yes","value":"ai its not really becoming a man client changing your life completely yeah"},{"from":"so im curious in your country is there something that signifies now you are an adult this","value":"kind of rite of passage ceremony or festivity or party that you have"},{"from":"in the us we dont really have that but i think its kind of a cool idea that youre celebrating ai i wish we did client this big change going from childhood to adulthood and it is a gray area at least","value":"in the us its a really gray area so its nice to celebrate that as parents that your"},{"from":"kids are adults hopefully and that as a child oh great now im an adult","value":"society sees me as an adult so i think its kind of a cool idea but maybe its something we can do with our future kids"},{"from":"all right lets go onto the next topic the next topic is jobs i want to know what was your worst job ever","value":"jobs"},{"from":"ai worst job ever client yeah ai well i
