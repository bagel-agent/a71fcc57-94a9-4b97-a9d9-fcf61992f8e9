§ 1505. DOCUMENTS TO BE PUBLISHED IN
FEDERAL REGISTER

having general applicability and legal eﬀect; documents
required to be published by Congress. There shall be published in the Federal Register—
(1) Presidential proclamations and Executive orders,
except those not having general applicability and legal effect or eﬀective only against Federal agencies or persons
in their capacity as oﬃcers, agents, or employees thereof;
(2) documents or classes of documents that the President may determine from time to time have general applicability and legal eﬀect; and
(3) documents or classes of documents that may be required so to be published by Act of Congress.
For the purposes of this chapter every document or order which prescribes a penalty has general applicability
and legal eﬀect.
(b) Documents authorized to be published by regulations; comments and news items excluded. In addition to
the foregoing there shall also be published in the Federal
Register other documents or classes of documents authorized to be published by regulations prescribed under this
chapter with the approval of the President, but comments
or news items of any character may not be published in the
Federal Register.(c) Suspension of requirements for filing
of documents; alternate systems for promulgating, filing,
or publishing documents; preservation of originals. In the
event of an attack or threatened attack upon the continental United States and a determination by the President
that as a result of an attack or threatened attack—
(1) publication of the Federal Register or filing of documents with the Oﬃce of the Federal Register is impracticable, or
(2) under existing conditions publication in the Federal

Register would not serve to give appropriate notice to the
public of the contents of documents, the President may,
without regard to any other provision of law, suspend all
or part of the requirements of law or regulation for filing
with the Oﬃce or publication in the Federal Register of
documents or classes of documents.
The suspensions shall remain in eﬀect until revoked by
the President, or by concurrent resolution of the Congress. The President shall establish alternate systems for
promulgating, filing, or publishing documents or classes
of documents aﬀected by such suspensions, including requirements relating to their eﬀectiveness or validity, that
may be considered under the then existing circumstances
practicable to provide public notice of the issuance and of
the contents of the documents. The alternate systems may,
without limitation, provide for the use of regional or specialized publications or depositories for documents, or of
the press, the radio, or similar mediums of general communication. Compliance with alternate systems of filing
or publication shall have the same eﬀect as filing with the
Oﬃce or publication in the Federal Register under this
chapter or other law or regulation. With respect to documents promulgated under alternate systems, each agency
shall preserve the original and two duplicate originals or
two certified copies for filing with the Oﬃce when the
President determines that it is practicable.
§ 1506. ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE OF
THE FEDERAL REGISTER; ESTABLISHMENT
AND COMPOSITION; POWERS AND DUTIES

shall consist of the Archivist of the United States or Acting Archivist, who shall be chairman, an oﬃcer of the Department of Justice designated by the Attorney General,
and the Director of the Government Publishing Oﬃce

of the committee. The committee shall prescribe, with
the approval of the President, regulations for carrying out
this chapter. The regulations shall provide, among other
things—

certified under section 1503 of this title, which certification may be permitted to be based upon confirmed communications from outside the District of Columbia;

BASIC L AWS and AUTHORITIES

| 13

(2) the documents which shall be authorized under section 1505(b) of this title to be published in the Federal
Register;
(3) the manner and form in which the Federal Register shall be printed, reprinted, and compiled, indexed,
bound, and distributed;
(4) the number of copies of the Federal Register, which
shall be printed, reprinted, and compiled, the number
which shall be distributed without charge to Members
of Congress, oﬃcers and employees of the United States,
or Federal agency, for oﬃcial use, and the number which
shall be available for distribution to the public; and
(5) the prices to be charged for individual copies of,
and subscriptions to, the Federal Register and reprints
and bound volumes of it.
§ 1507. FILING DOCUMENT AS
CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE; PUBLICATION IN
FEDERAL REGISTER AS PRESUMPTION OF

§ 1508. PUBLICATION IN FEDERAL REGISTER
AS NOTICE OF HEARING

A notice of hearing or of opportunity to be heard, required or authorized to be given by an Act of Congress, or
which may otherwise properly be given, shall be deemed
to have been given to all persons residing within the States
of the Union and the District of Columbia, except in cases where notice by publication is insuﬃcient in law, when
the notice is published in the Federal Register at such a
time that the period between the publication and the date
fixed in the notice for the hearing or for the termination
of the opportunity to be heard is—
(1) not less than the time specifically prescribed for the
publication of the notice by the appropriate Act of Congress; or
(2) not less than fifteen days when time for publication
is not specifically prescribed by the Act, without prejudice, however, to the eﬀectiveness of a notice of less than
fifteen days where the shorter period is reasonable.

VALIDITY; JUDICIAL NOTICE; CITATION

A document required by section 1505(a) of this title to
be published in the Federal Register is not valid as against
a person who has not had actual knowledge of it until
the duplicate originals or certified copies of the document
have been filed with the Oﬃce of the Federal Register and
a copy made available for public inspection as provided
by section 1503 of this title. Unless otherwise specifically provided by statute, filing of a document, required or
authorized to be published by section 1505 of this title,
except in cases where notice by publication is insuﬃcient
in law, is suﬃcient to give notice of the contents of the
document to a person subject to or aﬀected by it. The
publication in the Federal Register of a document creates
a rebuttable presumption—
(1) that it was duly issued, prescribed, or promulgated;
(2) that it was filed with the Oﬃce of the Federal Register and made available for public inspection at the day
and hour stated in the printed notation;
(3) that the copy contained in the Federal Register is a
true copy of the original; and
(4) that all requirements of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under it relative to the document have
been complied with.
The contents of the Federal Register shall be judicially noticed and without prejudice to any other mode of citation,
may be cited by volume and page number.

§ 1509. COSTS OF PUBLICATION, ETC.

(a) The cost of printing, reprinting, wrapping, binding, and distributing the Federal Register and the Code
of Federal Regulations, and, except as provided in subsection (b), other expenses incurred by the Government
Publishing Oﬃce in carrying out the duties placed upon
it by this chapter shall be charged to the revolving fund
provided in section 309. Reimbursements for such costs
and expenses shall be made by the Federal agencies and
credited, together with all receipts, as provided in section
309(b).
(b) The cost of printing, reprinting, wrapping, binding, and distributing all other publications of the Federal Register program, and other expenses incurred by the
Government Publishing Oﬃce in connection with such
publications, shall be borne by the appropriations to the
Government Publishing Oﬃce and the appropriations are
made available, and are authorized to be increased by additional sums necessary for the purposes, the increases to
be based upon estimates submitted by the Director of the
Government Publishing Oﬃce.
§ 1510. CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

(a) The Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, with the approval of the President, may require, from
time to time as it considers necessary, the preparation and

14 | BASIC LAWS and AUTHORITIES

publication in special or supplemental editions of the
Federal Register of complete codifications of the documents of each agency of the Government having general
applicability and legal eﬀect, issued or promulgated by the
agency by publication in the Federal Register or by filing
with the Administrative Committee, and are relied upon
by the agency as authority for, or are invoked or used by
it in the discharge of, its activities or functions, and are in
eﬀect as to facts arising on or after dates specified by the
Administrative Committee.
(b) A codification published under subsection (a) of
this section shall be printed and bound in permanent
form and shall be designated as the “Code of Federal
Regulations.” The Administrative Committee shall regulate the binding of the printed codifications into separate
books with a view to practical usefulness and economical
manufacture. Each book shall contain an explanation of
its coverage and other aids to users that the Administrative Committee may require. A general index to the entire
Code of Federal Regulations shall be separately printed
and bound.
(c) The Administrative Committee shall regulate the
supplementation and the collation and republication of
the printed codifications with a view to keeping the Code
of Federal Regulations as current as practicable. Each

book shall be either supplemented or collated and republished at least once each calendar year.
(d) The Oﬃce of the Federal Register shall prepare and
publish the codifications, supplements, collations, and indexes authorized by this section.
(e) The codified documents of the several agencies published in the supplemental edition of the
Federal Register under this section, as amended by documents subsequently filed with the Oﬃce and published
in the daily issues of the Federal Register, shall be prima
facie evidence of the text of the documents and of the fact
that they are in eﬀect on and after the date of publication.
(f ) The Administrative Committee shall prescribe, with
the approval of the President, regulations for carrying out
this section.
(g) This section does not require codification of the
text of Presidential documents published and periodically
compiled in supplements to Title 3 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.

EXCLUDED FROM PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER

This chapter does not apply to treaties, conventions,
protocols, and other international agreements, or proclamations thereof by the President.
